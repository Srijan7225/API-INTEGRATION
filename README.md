*DESCRIPTION*:
This project involves developing a simple, interactive webpage that fetches and displays real-time weather data from a public API. The chosen API is OpenWeatherMap, which provides free access to current weather 
details such as temperature, conditions, wind speed, and more. The core functionality is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The main steps involved in developing this project are:

1. Designing the input field and display area using HTML.
2. Styling the interface with CSS to make it user-friendly.
3. Writing JavaScript code to fetch data from the OpenWeatherMap API using the fetch() method.
3. Handling errors, such as when the user enters an invalid city name.

To make the project work, I have used free API key from OpenWeatherMap and insert it into the code.
